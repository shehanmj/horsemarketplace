A simple site that uses petfinder.com api to search for adoptable horses by zip code.

Written using only HTML, CSS and JQuery, due to restrictions on my hosting site. I plan to add more functionality and a local database 
that allows users to list their animals on this site rather than having to rely on petfinder api.
